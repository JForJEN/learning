  "summary": "Successfully resolved 59 merge conflicts across 9 files. The conflicts were primarily in README.md, backend/index.js, index.html, package-lock.json, railway.json, and vite.config.js. The resolution involved choosing the newer Railway deployment configuration over the older setup, updating the backend to use connection pooling instead of individual connections, adding cache control headers and domain redirect logic to index.html, and updating Vite configuration for production deployment. The package-lock.json was regenerated to ensure consistency.",
  "current_status": "All merge conflicts have been resolved. The codebase is now ready for deployment with the updated Railway configuration. The backend has been optimized with connection pooling and proper file serving, while the frontend includes cache control and domain redirect logic for production deployment."
