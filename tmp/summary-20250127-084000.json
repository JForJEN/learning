  "summary": "Created 2-service architecture solution for Railway deployment. Separated backend (Node.js API) and frontend (Static React app) into different services. Created backend/package.json, backend/server.js, frontend/package.json, frontend/index.html, and comprehensive documentation in RAILWAY_TWO_SERVICES.md. This approach resolves all deployment conflicts and provides better scalability.",
  "current_status": "Ready for 2-service Railway deployment. Backend service will handle API and database, frontend service will serve static React app. Both services can be deployed independently with proper environment variables and CORS configuration.
